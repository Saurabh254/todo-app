    ```

## Usage

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app
```

Replace `main:app` with the appropriate module and object where your FastAPI application is defined.

The server will start running at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## Endpoints

Document the endpoints available in your FastAPI application along with their functionality and usage examples.

For example:

- `/users/tasks`: Retrieve a list of items.
- `/users/tasks/create_task`: Create a new user.
- `/users/tasks/{id}`: delete a new user.
- `/users/tasks/{id}`: Retrieve or update user details by ID.

## Configuration

Document any configuration options or environment variables that can be used to customize the behavior of your application.

For example:

- `DATABASE_URL`: URL for connecting to the database.
- `TEST_DATABASE_URL`: URL for connecting to the test database.
